# ShowMeThatCat

## Description

The Cat Project is a web application built using PHP and SQL, with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the frontend. 
It allows users to manage information about cats, including their name, age, gender, breed, and traits. 
Users can add new cats, view a list of all cats on the homepage, click on individual cat images to view detailed 
information, edit existing cat details, and delete cats from the database. Additionally, users can filter cats 
on the homepage based on various criteria such as gender, age, and more.
